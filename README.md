# CRT-RSA-SPA-solved-by-runtime
## Challenge
1.Distinguish the difference between square and multiply operations
2.Noise interference and accuracy requirements

## Process
1.load and intercept the data
2.use gaussian_filter1d to observe the energy waveform
3.slice waveform
  * moving_average_filterld and middle_filterld
  * find_peaks
4.add up runtime
5.symbol distinguish
